Observation Statement:

If a "Pro" subscription offered unlimited transcription and advanced features, what is the MAXIMUM you would be willing to pay per month?

Supporting Data:

according to our survey responses the majority of our users were split 45.5% and 45.5% on them being willing to pay $5 or less for a pro subscription and paying between $6-$10. This "pro" subscription would include unlimited transcription from videos and voice to text along with other advanced features with no limitations or ads.

Team Action (if any):

By looking at this data we see that people are willing to pay between $6-$10, but I believe that shooting for the lowest price that being $5 is a smarter move to attract the most customers espeially with this being a new app.
