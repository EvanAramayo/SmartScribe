# 305Soft Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We commit to working hard, collaborating effectively, and communicating openly to achieve our common goals.

## Our Standards
### 1. No Distracted Use of Technology
   
 All members are expected to refrain from using technology (e.g., phones away) during team meetings to ensure full engagement and respect for all participants.

### 2. Decisions

 Decisions will be made by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will determine the outcome.

### 3. Attendance
   
 Members are expected to attend meetings regularly. Legitimate reasons for missing meetings include personal emergencies, illness, or prior commitments. Members who miss meetings should review meeting notes and reach out to teammates for updates.

### 4. Assignments
   
 Assignments will be distributed based on expertise and interest. Members who do not complete assignments will be approached to discuss challenges and find solutions. Continued non-completion may lead to reassignment of responsibilities.

### 5. Participation
   
 We will communicate through designated channels (e.g., email, chat) and ensure everyone has the opportunity to share their insights. We will honor member strengths and interests by involving them in relevant discussions and tasks.

### 6. Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums
   
 Meeting times will be decided through a poll to identify optimal times for all members. Locations or mediums will be selected based on accessibility and convenience for the entire group.

### 7. Agenda and Minutes/Notes
    
 The designated note-taker will be responsible for documenting meeting agendas and minutes. These will be shared with all members via email or a shared document.

### 8. Promptness
    
 Members are expected to arrive on time. If late, they should join quietly and catch up on missed discussions after the meeting.

### 9. Conversational Courtesies
    
 Active listening and respectful dialogue will be encouraged. Members should aim to share airtime fairly and stay on-topic while allowing for relevant tangents.

### 10. Enforcement/Feedback
    
 Community leaders will enforce these rules fairly. Feedback can be given anonymously or openly, depending on individual preferences. We encourage constructive criticism and support to foster a positive environment.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
 Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
 This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at uricsc305@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
 Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

## Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

## Attribution
