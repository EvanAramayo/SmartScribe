## Observation 2:

Observation Statement:
Most users prioritize the ability to convert transcribed text into formatted notes that can be directly exported to Word or Google Docs for easy editing. While some expressed interest in integrations with apps like Notion or Obsidian, their main concern is ensuring the transcript can be quickly turned into editable, well-structured documents.

Supporting Data:
From the survey question “Which productivity tools do you currently use? (Select all that apply)”, 68.2% of respondents selected Microsoft Word or Google Docs. In the survey question *“Which of the following do you record for note-taking purposes? (Select all that apply)”*, **72.7%** of respondents selected *University Lectures/Classes*, indicating that the app will be heavily used for lecture note-taking in academic settings. Consequently, **Google Docs** and **Microsoft Word** emerge as the most relevant text editors for users to format and edit their transcribed notes.

## Observation 5:

Observation Statement: Most people would want to use free tools for productivity and/or note taking

Supporting Data: From our question, "Imagine a tool that does everything described. Which pricing model would you prefer?" About 50% of responses want the tool to have a one time purchase price. About 27% of responses would like a free plan with limited minutes or uses. About 9% of responses would like a monthly subscription. There are 13% of responses that would like a way to 'pay-as-you-go' based on transcription minuted/credits used. Based on the data, it seems as though most people either want to pay once or just have a free plan.

Team Action (if any): Decide on the price of the tool, whether it should be free or a one time purchase
