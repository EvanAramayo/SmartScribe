## Observation 1:

Observation Statement: Many of the people who took our survey are currently not using any or do not have any budget for a note taking app, and it's features. Over 80% do not pay for any tools, or only use free tools. While on the contrary amongst those are willing to pay almost half of them currently spend upwards of $10-20 on note taking apps.

## Observation 2:

Observation Statement:
Most users prioritize the ability to convert transcribed text into formatted notes that can be directly exported to Word or Google Docs for easy editing. While some expressed interest in integrations with apps like Notion or Obsidian, their main concern is ensuring the transcript can be quickly turned into editable, well-structured documents.

Supporting Data:
From the survey question “Which productivity tools do you currently use? (Select all that apply)”, 68.2% of respondents selected Microsoft Word or Google Docs. In the survey question *“Which of the following do you record for note-taking purposes? (Select all that apply)”*, **72.7%** of respondents selected *University Lectures/Classes*, indicating that the app will be heavily used for lecture note-taking in academic settings. Consequently, **Google Docs** and **Microsoft Word** emerge as the most relevant text editors for users to format and edit their transcribed notes.

Team Action (if any):
Implement a feature such as a dropdown button, enable one-click syncing, etc, that allows users to save or export their formatted transcript as a Word (.docx) or Google Docs file.


## Observation 3:

Observation Statement: The predominant concern among users is the potential for inaccuracies in translation.

Supporting Data: According to our survey, 86.4% of respondents ranked high-accuracy transcription as the most valuable feature. This underscores that translation inaccuracy is their primary concern.

Team Action (if any): Prioritize translation precision


## Observation 4:

Observation Statement:

If a "Pro" subscription offered unlimited transcription and advanced features, what is the MAXIMUM you would be willing to pay per month?

Supporting Data:

according to our survey responses the majority of our users were split 45.5% and 45.5% on them being willing to pay $5 or less for a pro subscription and paying between $6-$10. This "pro" subscription would include unlimited transcription from videos and voice to text along with other advanced features with no limitations or ads.

Team Action (if any):

By looking at this data we see that people are willing to pay between $6-$10, but I believe that shooting for the lowest price that being $5 is a smarter move to attract the most customers espeially with this being a new app. 


## Observation 5:

Observation Statement: Most people would want to pay for a tool once for productivity and/or note taking but there are also people who would want to have a free plan

Supporting Data: From our question, "Imagine a tool that does everything described. Which pricing model would you prefer?" About 50% of responses want the tool to have a one time purchase price. About 27% of responses would like a free plan with limited minutes or uses. About 9% of responses would like a monthly subscription. There are 13% of responses that would like a way to 'pay-as-you-go' based on transcription minuted/credits used. Based on the data, it seems as though most people either want to pay once or just have a free plan.

Team Action (if any): Decide on the price of the tool, whether it should be free or a one time purchase
